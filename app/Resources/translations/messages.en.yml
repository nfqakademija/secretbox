section.about: About project SECRET BOX
section.about.paragraph: >
    The idea of SECRET BOX is to give more spontaneity and joy of discovery for you and for your friends.
    What is inside SECRET BOX? – it is a clue object, prepared by us and our partners, that you can order for youself or for your friends.
    A clue object will help you to find out a secret - at the end it is always a present, that can vary from
    a posh degustation or dinner, an exclussive accessory or clothes,
    practical service or an impressive event. Every time we guarantee an unexpectedness – only when you come up to a place headed by a clue object you will find out
    a real present that was inside SECRET BOX.
